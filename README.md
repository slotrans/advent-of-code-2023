I don't actually know C++ so I'm sure I'm doing tons of wrong stuff.

- Apple clang version 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)
- Catch2 2.13.10 for unit testing
- fmt 10.1.1 because clang hasn't implemented std::format yet
- pystring 1.1.4 because life is too short to write your own string functions

2023-11-24: I totally lost interest this year. Oh well.
